##Firefly computing system

*To use this software, you must have `python3` and `tkinter` installed.*
### On Debian Linux derivatives:
```sh
sudo apt-get install python3 python3tk
```

- `Ultron.py` is the high level language compiler (High level language -> VM intermediate format).
- `VirtualMachine.py` is the virtual machine translator (VM commands -> Assembly commands).
- `Jarvis.py` is the assembler and CPU simulator (Assembly commands -> binary).

The test code and some skeleton files are provided by the book [*The Elements of Computing Systems*](http://nand2tetris.org) by Noam Nisan and Shimon Schocken (MIT Press).
